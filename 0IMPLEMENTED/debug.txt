// If aplying ceil,floor,pow,etc convert it into integer (might make you eat shit if you don't
// Whenever using stacks,queues,etc always check that their top / front / back elements are not accessed when they are empty, thus causing runtime error
// Think twice before using greedy
// Remember losing 1 or 2 minutes is better than a penalty of 10 minutes
// Use log2 instead of log()/log(2) to avoid shitty errors
// If declaring a large array, define it globally
// Always initialise anything while declaring, which will not be taken as input
// In case of a problem having decimal calculations, try declaring everything in double rather than typecasting in each step
// always declare the array with n+5 elements to avoid unexpected errors
// Every problem cannot be solved by DFS easily, think of BFS too



*******************my debug*******************
//check for boundary cases
//see if you dont keep summed or multiplied value in long long
//didnt initialise things like sum=0
//try to go for best solution rather than optimizing current
//READ THE QUESTION PROPERLY check sample cases before typing


//keep check for previously used iterators for list whether initialised again properly or not else segmentation fault
